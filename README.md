# Odin-Etch-A-Sketch

A simple Etch-a-Sketch project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). The main objective with this is to flex DOM manipulation skills and to play a little bit with CSS Flexbox.

I really like drawing and art so, to me, this project was pretty cool and funny to build!

I am still thinking about doind a prettier UI to it or not.

Anyways, as always I would like to thank The Odin Project. I really think I am growing and getting somewhere.
